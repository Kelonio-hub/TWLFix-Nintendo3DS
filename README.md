# TWLFix-CFW
Uninstall the stock TWL apps, to allow system to reinstall them from CDN


##### Note: 
If someone installed these titles as standard cias, and then manually removed them without removing tickets, they would need to:
1. Open FBI->tickets
1. Click any ticket
1. Choose "delete unused tickets"

TWL Version Data cannot be restored without a ticket. The other titles can be.
Manually reinstalling TWL Version Data is the only option if this unique situation has occurred. 

This App does not resolve the above issue.
